Quickly build an admin panel for your Eloquent models, then customize every little detail. Among the FREE features of each admin interface:
- [List](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-list-entries) operation
   - 24 column types
   - 1-1, 1-n and n-n relationships
   - table view with search, pagination
   - click column header to sort by it
   - custom buttons
   - details row
   - easily create new column types
   - easily override an existing column type
- [Create](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-create) / [Update](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-update) operations
   - 29 field types
   - back-end validation using Laravel Form Requests
   - translatable models (multi-language)
   - have multiple fields per line
   - split fields into tabs
- [Delete](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-delete) operation
- [Reorder](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-reorder) operation
- [Revise](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/crud-operation-revisions) operation (aka. audit log)

But professionals don't love Backpack just because it's feature-packed. They also love it because it's **ridiculously easy to override a functionality**. Generally, you just need to create a function (or blade file) with the right name. Yes, it can be _that_ easy.

> Need more complex features? Purchase [Backpack PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing), our closed-source paid add-on. It will add **5 more operations, 10 filters, 28 more fields, 6 more columns and 1 more widget**. For more info, see our [FREE vs PRO comparison table](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/features-free-vs-paid). We believe it's everything you need to build admin panels of _any_ complexity.
